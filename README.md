# Hello-world
I'm known to you all as Designer1900,
why that particular name? i'm a hobby artist i used to work at an artworkshop and i'm interested in history and the 1900's seemed a good start for a name.
I'm 2,02 meters tall and rather hyperactive due to my adhd,
i'm very passionate about food, games, movies and music.
But what i like above all is books,
i have a bit of wanderlust.
I'm a bit of a prankster,
i'm also part of a competitive swimming team since a few years.
I tried to become a book author.
