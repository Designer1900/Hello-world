# Hello-world
I'm known to you all as Designer1900
why that particular name? i'm a hobby artist and used to work at an artworkshop and i'm interested in history and the 1900's seemed a good start for a name
i'm 2,02 meters tall and rather hyperactive due to my adhd
i'm very passionate about food, games, movies and music
but what i like above all is books
i have a bit of wanderlust
i'm a bit of a prankster
i'm also part of a competitive swimming team since a few years
i tried to become a book author
