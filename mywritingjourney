I had many projects over the years, from videogame story ideas to book ideas like where ( werewolf lovestory ).
But also an untitled one about a down on his luck magican who finds out he's a decendant of merlin and he has to help prevent an evil wizard escaping from a magical seal under stonehenge.
but wesboek, that one turned sort of in this hello-world project on this site.
